  - `clustering.py`: Handles clustering of demographic data.
  - `preprocessing.py`: Manages data preprocessing tasks such as merging datasets and handling missing values.
  - `visualization.py`: Provides functions for visualizing data and results.

- `/notebooks`: Contains Jupyter notebooks documenting the analysis process.
  - `01_preprocessing.ipynb`: Data preprocessing steps, including merging datasets and imputing missing values.
  - `01_preprocessing_DT.ipynb`: Decision Tree-specific preprocessing steps.
  - `02_var_clustering.ipynb`: Variable clustering analysis.
  - `02_feature_pca.ipynb`: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction.
  - `02_feature_pca_with_missingness.ipynb`: PCA considering missing data patterns.
  - `02_feature_selection.ipynb`: Feature selection techniques and results.
  - `03_demographic_clustering.ipynb`: Clustering analysis based on demographic data.
  - `04_modeling_DT.ipynb`: Decision Tree modeling.
  - `04_modeling_LR.ipynb`: Logistic Regression modeling.
  - `04_modeling_RF.ipynb`: Random Forest modeling.
  - `05_results.ipynb`: Compilation and discussion of modeling results.
 

## Analysis Workflow

The project follows these main steps:

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Merging datasets.
   - Imputing missing values.
   - Encoding missingness based on defined thresholds.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing participant data across different weeks.
   - Assessing variable distributions and missingness.
   - Feature selection using linear regression techniques.

3. **Clustering**
   - Variable clustering to identify related features.
   - Demographic data clustering to segment participants.

4. **Modeling**
   - Applying Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines to build predictive models.
   - Evaluating model performance and comparing results.

5. **Results**
   - Compiling results from various models.
   - Interpreting findings and discussing implications.

## Dependencies

To replicate the analysis, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Execute the scripts in the `/scripts` directory or run the `01_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to preprocess the data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Use the EDA notebooks (`02_var_clustering.ipynb`, `02_feature_pca.ipynb`, etc.) to explore and visualize the data.

3. **Feature Selection and Clustering**: Apply feature selection methods and perform clustering analyses using the corresponding notebooks.

4. **Modeling**: Run the modeling notebooks (`04_modeling_DT.ipynb`, `04_modeling_LR.ipynb`, etc.) to build and evaluate predictive models.

5. **Results Analysis**: Review the `05_results.ipynb` notebook for a comprehensive analysis of model performance and findings.
